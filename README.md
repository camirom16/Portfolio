# Projet - Portfolio

This README.md file explains the though process behind the design and implementation of my portfolio. 

##The purpose

The main purpose of this portfolio project is to showcase the skills, projects, and accomplishments that I have acquired in the last two months and show my potential to future employers, clients, and collaborators. 

## Design

**Minimalism and Simplicity**

- The goal is to keed the focus on the content and make it easy for users to navigate through the website. 

**Responsive Design**

- The user can navigate through the website using any device. The portfolio was made to be responsive and will adapt to the various screen sizes, including smartphones, tablets and desktops. 

**Consistency**

- I aimed to maintain consistency throughout the website, using the same color scheme, typography, and navigation style across all pages. This consistency ensures that users can easily understand how to interact with the website.

## Implementation

The tech stack includes: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React. 
To make the code reusable, I structure the website using component, such as the header, hero page, about me, projects and contact form. 

I use Git to track all the changes made on the portfolio and make the improuvements needed. 

Finally, the website is deplyed in Vercel to make it accessible to others.
